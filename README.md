# Sports Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive sports analysis that utilizes data science methodologies to predict, analyze, and visualize trends in sports performance. Leveraging **Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio** for predictive modeling, **Python** for exploratory data analysis (EDA), and **Power BI** for data visualization, this project aims to deliver actionable insights for stakeholders in the sports domain.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

```
├── data/                      # Raw and processed data files (excluded in .gitignore)
├── colab_notebook/            # Colab notebooks for EDA and trend analysis
├── scripts/                   # Python scripts for data preprocessing and analysis
├── visuals/                   # Power BI dashboards and visualizations
├── requirements.txt           # Python dependencies
└── README.md                  # Project overview and documentation
```

## Objectives
1. **Predictive Analysis**: Build a predictive model to forecast outcomes using historical sports data.
2. **Trend Discovery**: Perform EDA to uncover key trends, patterns, and correlations in the data.
3. **Visualization**: Create an interactive Power BI dashboard to display insights in a clear, visual format.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio**: For creating, training, and deploying the predictive model.
- **Python**: For data preprocessing, EDA, and trend analysis, using libraries such as:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations
  - `scikit-learn` for model building and evaluation
- **Power BI**: For developing a user-friendly dashboard that visualizes trends and predictive insights.

## Data Collection
The dataset used in this project consists of [describe dataset briefly, e.g., historical match data, player statistics, etc.]. The data was collected from [source, e.g., public sports databases, APIs].

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted using Python to gain an initial understanding of the data. Key steps included:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new variables to enhance model performance.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Identifying trends, correlations, and patterns among key performance metrics.

## Predictive Modeling
The predictive model was developed in Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio:
1. **Model Selection**: A selection of models (e.g., decision trees, random forests, neural networks) were evaluated for accuracy.
2. **Training and Testing**: Models were trained on historical data and validated using cross-validation techniques.
3. **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best-performing model.

## Visualization with Power BI
The insights and predictions were visualized in Power BI, creating an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore:
- Key trends in player and team performance
- Predictive insights based on historical data
- Dynamic filters to customize views by season, team, or player

## Key Findings
1. **Prediction Accuracy**: The final model achieved an accuracy of [XX%], with [model name] proving to be the most effective algorithm.
2. **Trend Insights**: [Describe any major trends identified, e.g., certain teams performing better in specific conditions].
3. **Player Performance**: [Highlight any findings on player-specific metrics].

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/sports-analysis.git
   cd sports-analysis
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run EDA scripts:
   ```bash
   python scripts/eda.py
   ```

4. View the Power BI Dashboard:
   - Open `visuals/dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.

## Future Work
- **Expand Data Sources**: Incorporate real-time data and additional performance metrics.
- **Model Improvements**: Experiment with more advanced algorithms like deep learning.
- **Enhanced Visualizations**: Add more interactivity and filters to the Power BI dashboard.
